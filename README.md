#WAGGLE
##About
Have you ever noticed a group of friends at a restaurant and everyone is lost on their smart phones, not engaging with each other at all? As much as I love technology and social-media, I feel that it's more important to be present and engaged in the moment. Waggle is designed to use technology to lose technology, so to speak.
